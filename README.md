# Automatic-Slot-Machine
This is a self learning project for an automatic slot machine game using Java.

I completed this project as a way to learn file I/O and handling single variables multiple times throughout a loop.
The code runs through 3 different slot machines with different payouts and win rates until the quarters variable hits 0.
Winning adds more quarters to utilize which elongates the loop time.
